The notebook is structured as a series of cells and comments, from data exploration to building and optimizing a first starter model using XGBoost. By following it you can understabnd both the data problem and grasp the actions to be taken with similar tabular data problems.

The approach is to explore data using the essential commands for tabular and chart representations. Often, on Kaggle Notebooks for competitions, EDA is weighted with tons of charts and plots that you cannot understand what they serve for, based on the principle "The More The Merrier". The idea is instead to just go to the point and show the relevant plots and keyt understanding in a dataset that could help you to devise the better strategies and feature engineering.

The modelling part is also striving to just do the essential, hence you will find a single model devised to show how far you can go with the state of the art in tabular data modelling, i.e. XGBoost.
The notebook is arrange into six parts, with sections:

1. Data loading and first exploration
2. Target analysis
3. EDA and data preparation
4. Modelling
5. Explainability
6. Preparation of the submission
